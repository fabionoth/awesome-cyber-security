[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A collection of awesome software, libraries, documents, books, resources, and cool stuff about security.

Inspired by [Awesome Security](https://github.com/sbilly/awesome-security) and [Herman Slatman](https://github.com/hslatman).

Thanks to all [contributors](https://github.com/fabionoth/awesome-cyber-security/graphs/contributors). You're awesome. This wouldn't be possible without you! The goal is to build a categorized, community-driven collection of very well-known resources.
